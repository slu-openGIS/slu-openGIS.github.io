      <description>About the SLU DSS We are a collaborative, interdisciplinary group at Saint Louis University focused on building community around open source software and open science. Our goal is to bring faculty, students, and staff together from around the University in a way that bridges traditional barriers to collaboration and learning within colleges and universities. We are also dedicated to creating a welcoming, inclusive data science community here at SLU.</description>

      <description>The SLU Data Science Seminar is the host of Chris Prener&amp;rsquo;s openGIS project. The project is a collaborative effort with SLU students to curate and host GIS data about the St. Louis area in an accessible manner. We also maintain several R packages that contain tools for working with spatial data. More details about our projects and our commitment to creating an inclusive, welcoming data science community are available on our About page.</description>
