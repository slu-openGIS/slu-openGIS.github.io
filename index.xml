      <description>The openGIS project is a collaborative effort with SLU students to curate and host GIS data about the St. Louis area in an accessible manner. Additionally, work on software engineering projects to create and maintain tools for working with local data. As with the DSS, we are also dedicated to creating a welcoming, inclusive data science community here at SLU (see the ‘Inclusion and our Code of Conduct’ section below).</description>

      <description>The SLU Data Science Seminar is the host of Chris Prener&amp;rsquo;s openGIS project. The project is a collaborative effort with SLU students to curate and host GIS data about the St. Louis area in an accessible manner. We also maintain several R packages that contain tools for working with spatial data. More details about our projects and our commitment to creating an inclusive, welcoming data science community are available on our About page.</description>
